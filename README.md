Contains a Python function which finds the maximum entropy Nash equilibrium of a given payoff matrix.
The importance of such a computation was initially raised to me through the paper [Re-evaluating Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02643), where it is presented as a way of evaluating many different machine learning systems against many different tasks.
I found the paper [Maximum entropy correlated equilibria](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v2/ortiz07a/ortiz07a.pdf) helpful for creating an implementation, although I did not use the method they spend the bulk of their paper discussing.
